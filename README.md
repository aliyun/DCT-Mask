## Contributions
- We propose a high-quality and low-complexity mask representation for instance segmentation, which encodes the high-resolution binary mask into a compact vector with discrete cosine transform.
- With slight modifications, DCT-Mask could be integrated
  into most pixel-based frameworks, and achieve
  significant and consistent improvement on different
  datasets, backbones, and training schedules. Specifically,
  it obtains more improvements for more complex
  backbones and higher-quality annotations.
- DCT-Mask does not require extra pre-processing or
  pre-training. It achieves high-resolution mask prediction
  at a speed similar to low-resolution.

## Installation
#### Requirements
- PyTorch â‰¥ 1.5 and fvcore == 0.1.1.post20200716

This implementation is based on [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2). Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). for installation and dataset preparation.

#### Notes
- We observe about 0.2 AP noise in COCO.
- High variance observed in CityScapes when trained on fine annotations only. 
  We report the median of 5 runs AP in the article (i.e. 35.6), while in this repo we report the best results (37.0).
- Initialized from COCO pre-training will reduce the variance on CityScapes as well as increasing mask AP.
- The inference time is measured on single GPU with batchsize 1. All GPUs are NVIDIA V100.
- [Lvis 0.5](https://) is used for evaluation.
